usage: subcommands compare [OPTIONS] <FILE1> <FILE2>

Compare two UXF files for equality ignoring insignificant whitespace, or for
equivalence (with -e or --equivalent) in which case the comparison ignores
insignificant whitespace, comments, unused ttypes, and, in effect replaces any
imports with the ttypes they defineâ€”if they are used. If a diff is required,
format the two UXF files using the same formatting options (and maybe use the -s
--standalone option), then use a standard diff tool.

positional arguments:
  <FILE1> <FILE2>  
        The two files to compare. Each may have any suffix and may be
        gzip-compressed if it ends with .gz

optional arguments:
  -e, --equivalent  Compare for equivalance rather than for equality
  -h, --help        Show help and quit.
