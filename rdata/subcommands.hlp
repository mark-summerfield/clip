usage: subcommands [OPTION] [SUBCOMMAND] ...

subcommands:
  c, compare [-e] <FILE1> <FILE2>  
        Compare two UXF files for equality ignoring insignificant
        whitespace, or for equivalence (with -e or --equivalent) in
        which case the comparison ignores insignificant whitespace,
        comments, unused ttypes, and, in effect replaces any imports
        with the ttypes they defineâ€”if they are used. If a diff is
        required, format the two UXF files using the same formatting
        options (and maybe use the -s --standalone option), then use a
        standard diff tool.
  f, format [OPTIONS] <INFILE> <OUTFILE>  
        Copy the infile to the outfile using the canonical
        human-readable format, or with the specified formatting options.
        This will alphabetically order any ttype definitions and will
        order map items by key (bytes < date < datetime < int <
        case-insensitive str). However, the order of imports is
        preserved (with any duplicates removed) to allow later imports
        to override earlier ones. The conversion will also automatically
        perform type repairs, e.g., converting strings to dates or ints
        or reals if that is the target type, and similar.
  l, lint <FILE> [FILE ...]  
        Print the repairs that formatting would apply and lint warnings
        (if any) to stderr for the given file(s).

optional arguments:
  -v, --version  Show version and quit
  -h, --help  Show help text and quit
